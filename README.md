# paragon-coding-test

Input an arbitary date in 2023, and it will display the closest company holiday.

Additionally, it will display a happiness score which is determined by the following conditons:
Within 0-30 days: 10 points
Within 31-60 days: 5 points
Within 61-90 days: 1 point

One more feature is that it will calculate the lowest and highest happiness dates in terms of
happiness scores. It is incomplete in that it does not take into account that dates may have the same
happiness scores, a simple array push_back implementation is needed.

It also runs a few unit tests as seen in the console.
